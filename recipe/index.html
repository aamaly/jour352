    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <h3>How to ripen bananas quicker</h3>
    <p>Place bananas in a paper bag and leave them in a warm area for quicker ripening. When the peels get spotted and
        blacken slightly, and become soft they will be ready</p>
    <h3>How to store banana bread</h3>
    <p>Once the bread cools, store it in an airtight container for one day on the counter and then in the fridge for up
        to a week.</p>
