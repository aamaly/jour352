            <p>Bangladesh,[a] officially the People's Republic of Bangladesh,[b] is a country in South Asia. It is the
                eighth-most populous country in the world and among the most densely populated with a population of 170
                million in an area of 148,460 square kilometres (57,320 sq mi). Bangladesh shares land borders with
                India to the north, west, and east, and Myanmar to the southeast. To the south, it has a coastline along
                the Bay of Bengal. It is separated from Bhutan and Nepal by the Siliguri Corridor, and from China by the
                mountainous Indian state of Sikkim. Dhaka, the capital and largest city, is the nation's political,
                financial, and cultural centre. Chittagong is the second-largest city and the busiest port. The official
                language is Bengali, with Bangladeshi English also used in government.</p>
            <p>Bangladesh is part of the historic and ethnolinguistic region of Bengal, which was divided during the
                Partition of British India in 1947 as the eastern enclave of the Dominion of Pakistan, from which it
                gained independence in 1971 after a bloody war.[17] The country has a Bengali Muslim majority. Ancient
                Bengal was known as Gangaridai and was a stronghold of pre-Islamic kingdoms. The Muslim conquest after
                1204 led to the sultanate and Mughal periods, during which an independent Bengal Sultanate and wealthy
                Mughal Bengal transformed the region into an important centre of regional affairs, trade, and diplomacy.
                The Battle of Plassey in 1757 marked the beginning of British rule. The creation of Eastern Bengal and
                Assam in 1905 set a precedent for the emergence of Bangladesh. The All-India Muslim League was founded
                in Dhaka in 1906.[18] The Lahore Resolution in 1940 was supported by A. K. Fazlul Huq, the first Prime
                Minister of Bengal. The present-day territorial boundary was established with the announcement of the
                Radcliffe Line.</p>
            <p>In 1947, East Bengal became the most populous province in the Dominion of Pakistan and was renamed East
                Pakistan, with Dhaka as the legislative capital. The Bengali Language Movement in 1952, the 1958
                Pakistani coup d'Ã©tat, and the 1970 Pakistani general election spurred Bengali nationalism and
                pro-democracy movements. The refusal of the Pakistani military junta to transfer power to the Awami
                League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, triggered the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971. The Mukti Bahini,
                aided by India, waged a successful armed revolution; the conflict saw the Bangladeshi genocide. The new
                state of Bangladesh became a constitutionally secular state in 1972, although Islam was declared the
                state religion in 1988.[19] In 2010, the Bangladesh Supreme Court reaffirmed secular principles in the
                constitution.[20] The Constitution of Bangladesh officially declares it a socialist state.[21]</p>
            <p>A middle power in the Indo-Pacific,[22] Bangladesh is home to the fifth-most spoken native language, the
                third-largest Muslim-majority population, and the second-largest economy in South Asia. It maintains the
                third-largest military in the region and is the largest contributor to UN peacekeeping operations.[23]
                Bangladesh is a unitary parliamentary republic based on the Westminster system. Bengalis make up almost
                99% of the population.[24] The country consists of eight divisions, 64 districts, and 495 subdistricts,
                and includes the world's largest mangrove forest. Bangladesh hosts one of the largest refugee
                populations due to the Rohingya genocide.[25] Bangladesh faces challenges like corruption, political
                instability, overpopulation, and effects of climate change. Bangladesh has twice chaired the Climate
                Vulnerable Forum and hosts the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic
                Cooperation (BIMSTEC) headquarters. It is a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional
                Cooperation (SAARC) and a member of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Commonwealth of
                Nations.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The history of Bangladesh dates back over four millennia to the Chalcolithic period. The region's early
                history was characterized by a succession of Hindu and Buddhist kingdoms and empires that fought for
                control over the Bengal region. Islam arrived in the 8th century and gradually became dominant from the
                early 13th century with the conquests led by Bakhtiyar Khalji and the activities of Sunni missionaries
                like Shah Jalal. Muslim rulers promoted the spread of Islam by building mosques across the region. From
                the 14th century onward, Bengal was ruled by the Bengal Sultanate, founded by Fakhruddin Mubarak Shah,
                who established an individual currency. The Bengal Sultanate expanded under rulers like Shamsuddin Ilyas
                Shah, leading to economic prosperity and military dominance, with Bengal being referred to by Europeans
                as the richest country to trade with. The region later became a part of the Mughal Empire, and according
                to historian C. A. Bayly, it was probably the empire's wealthiest province.</p>
            <p>Following the decline of the Mughal Empire in the early 1700s, Bengal became a semi-independent state
                under the Nawabs of Bengal, ultimately led by Siraj-ud-Daulah. It was later conquered by the British
                East India Company after the Battle of Plassey in 1757. Bengal played a crucial role in the Industrial
                Revolution in Britain, but also faced significant deindustrialization. The Bengal Presidency was
                established during British rule.</p>
            <img src="img/history-bangaldesh-02.gif" alt="Bangladesh">
            <p>The borders of modern Bangladesh were established with the partition of Bengal between India and Pakistan
                during the Partition of India in August 1947, when the region became East Pakistan as part of the newly
                formed State of Pakistan following the end of the British rule in the region. The Proclamation of
                Bangladeshi Independence in March 1971 led to the nine-month-long Bangladesh Liberation War, which
                culminated in the emergence of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. Independence was declared by Sheikh
                Mujibur Rahman in 1971.</p>
            <p>Since gaining independence, Bangladesh has faced political instability, economic reconstruction, and
                social transformation. The country experienced military coups and authoritarian rule, notably under
                General Ziaur Rahman and General Hussain Muhammad Ershad. The restoration of parliamentary democracy in
                the 1990s saw power alternate between the Awami League, and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. In recent
                decades, Bangladesh has achieved significant economic growth, emerging as one of the world's
                fastest-growing economies, driven by its garment industry, remittances, and infrastructure development.
                However, it continues to grapple with political instability, human rights issues, and the impact of
                climate change. The return of the Awami League to power in 2009 under Sheikh Hasina's leadership saw
                economic progress but criticisms of authoritarianism. Bangladesh has played a critical role in
                addressing regional issues, including the Rohingya refugee crisis, which has strained its resources and
                highlighted its humanitarian commitments.</p>
            <p>The poverty rate went down from 80% in 1971 to 44% in 1991 to 13% in 2021.[36][37][38] Bangladesh emerged
                as the second-largest economy in South Asia,[39][40] surpassing the per capita income levels of both
                India and Pakistan.[41][40] As part of the green transition, Bangladesh's industrial sector emerged as a
                leader in building green factories, with the country having the largest number of certified green
                factories in the world in 2023.[42] In January 2024, Awami League led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
                secured a fourth straight term in Bangladesh's general election. Following nationwide protests against
                the Awami League government, on 5 August 2024, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was forced to resign and
                flee to India.[43][44][45][46][47] An interim government was formed on 8 August, with Nobel laureate
                Muhammad Yunus as the Chief Advisor.[48]</p>

            <h2>Geography</h2>
            <p><i>Main article: Geography of Bangladesh</i></p>
            <p>Bangladesh is in South Asia on the Bay of Bengal. It is surrounded almost entirely by neighbouring India,
                and shares a small border with Myanmar to its southeast, though it lies very close to Nepal, Bhutan, and
                China. The country is divided into three regions. Most of the country is dominated by the fertile Ganges
                Delta, the largest river delta in the world.[49] The northwest and central parts of the country are
                formed by the Madhupur and the Barind plateaus. The northeast and southeast are home to evergreen hill
                ranges.</p>

            <img src="img/map-bangladesh.jpg" alt="Bangladesh">

            <p>The Ganges delta is formed by the confluence of the Ganges (local name Padma or PÃ´dda), Brahmaputra
                (Jamuna or Jomuna), and Meghna rivers and their tributaries. The Ganges unites with the Jamuna (main
                channel of the Brahmaputra) and later joins the Meghna, finally flowing into the Bay of Bengal.
                Bangladesh is called the "Land of Rivers"[50], as it is home to over 57 trans-boundary rivers, the most
                of any nation-state. Water issues are politically complicated since Bangladesh is downstream of
                India.[51]</p>

            <p>Bangladesh is predominantly rich fertile flat land. Most of it is less than 12 m (39 ft) above sea level,
                and it is estimated that about 10% of its land would be flooded if the sea level were to rise by 1 m
                (3.3 ft).[52] 17% of the country is covered by forests and 12% is covered by hill systems. The country's
                haor wetlands are of significance to global environmental science. The highest point in Bangladesh is
                the Saka Haphong, located near the border with Myanmar, with an elevation of 1,064 m (3,491 ft).[53]
                Previously, either Keokradong or Tazing Dong were considered the highest.</p>

            <h3>Climate</h3>
            <p><i>Main articles: Geography of Bangladesh Â§ Climate, and Climate change in Bangladesh</i></p>
            <p>Straddling the Tropic of Cancer, Bangladesh's climate is tropical, with a mild winter from October to
                March and a hot, humid summer from March to June. The country has never recorded an air temperature
                below 0 Â°C (32 Â°F), with a record low of 1.1 Â°C (34.0 Â°F) in the northwest city of Dinajpur on 3
                February 1905.[54] A warm and humid monsoon season lasts from June to October and supplies most of the
                country's rainfall. Natural calamities, such as floods, tropical cyclones, tornadoes, and tidal bores
                occur almost every year,[55] combined with the effects of deforestation, soil degradation and erosion.
                The cyclones of 1970 and 1991 were particularly devastating, the latter killing approximately 140,000
                people.[56]</p>

            <p>In September 1998, Bangladesh saw the most severe flooding in modern history, after which two-thirds of
                the country went underwater, along with a death toll of 1,000.[57] As a result of various international
                and national level initiatives in disaster risk reduction, the human toll and economic damage from
                floods and cyclones have come down over the years.[58] The 2007 South Asian floods ravaged areas across
                the country, leaving five million people displaced, with a death toll around 500.[59]</p>
            <img src="img/climate-bangladesh.jpg.webp" alt="Bangladesh">
            <h4>Climate change</h4>
            <p><i>Main article: Climate change in Bangladesh</i></p>
            <p>Bangladesh is recognised to be one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change.[60][61] Over the
                course of a century, 508 cyclones have affected the Bay of Bengal region, 17 percent of which are
                believed to have made landfall in Bangladesh.[62] Natural hazards that come from increased rainfall,
                rising sea levels, and tropical cyclones are expected to increase as the climate changes, each seriously
                affecting agriculture, water and food security, human health, and shelter.[63] It is estimated that by
                2050, a three-foot rise in sea levels will inundate some 20 percent of the land and displace more than
                30 million people.[64] To address the sea level rise threat in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Delta Plan
                2100 has been launched.[65][66]</p>
            <h3>Biodiversity</h3>
            <p><i>Main article: Fauna of Bangladesh</i></p>
            <p>Bangladesh is located in the Indomalayan realm, and lies within four terrestrial ecoregions: Lower
                Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests, MizoramâManipurâKachin rain forests, Sundarbans freshwater
                swamp forests, and Sundarbans mangroves.[67] Its ecology includes a long sea coastline, numerous rivers
                and tributaries, lakes, wetlands, evergreen forests, semi evergreen forests, hill forests, moist
                deciduous forests, freshwater swamp forests and flat land with tall grass. The Bangladesh Plain is
                famous for its fertile alluvial soil which supports extensive cultivation. The country is dominated by
                lush vegetation, with villages often buried in groves of mango, jackfruit, bamboo, betel nut, coconut,
                and date palm.[68] The country has up to 6000 species of plant life, including 5000 flowering
                plants.[69] Water bodies and wetland systems provide a habitat for many aquatic plants. Water lilies and
                lotuses grow vividly during the monsoon season. The country has 50 wildlife sanctuaries.</p>

            <p>Bangladesh is home to most of the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest, covering an area of
                6,000 square kilometres (2,300 sq mi) in the southwest littoral region. It is divided into three
                protected sanctuariesâthe South, East, and West zones. The forest is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The
                northeastern Sylhet region is home to haor wetlands, a unique ecosystem. It also includes tropical and
                subtropical coniferous forests, a freshwater swamp forest, and mixed deciduous forests. The southeastern
                Chittagong region covers evergreen and semi-evergreen hilly jungles. Central Bangladesh includes the
                plainland Sal forest running along with the districts of Gazipur, Tangail, and Mymensingh. St. Martin's
                Island is the only coral reef in the country.</p>
                <img src="img/bangladesh-01.webp" alt="Bangladesh">
            <p>Bangladesh has an abundance of wildlife in its forests, marshes, woodlands, and hills.[68] The vast
                majority of animals dwell within a habitat of 150,000 square kilometres (58,000 sq mi).[70] The Bengal
                tiger, clouded leopard, saltwater crocodile, black panther and fishing cat are among the chief predators
                in the Sundarbans.[71] Northern and eastern Bangladesh is home to the Asian elephant, hoolock gibbon,
                Asian black bear and oriental pied hornbill.[72] The chital deer are widely seen in southwestern
                woodlands. Other animals include the black giant squirrel, capped langur, Bengal fox, sambar deer,
                jungle cat, king cobra, wild boar, mongooses, pangolins, pythons and water monitors. Bangladesh has one
                of the largest populations of Irrawaddy and Ganges dolphins.[73] The country has numerous species of
                amphibians (53), reptiles (139), marine reptiles (19) and marine mammals (5). It also has 628 species of
                birds.[74]</p>

            <p>Several animals became extinct in Bangladesh during the last century, including the one-horned and
                two-horned rhinoceros and common peafowl. The human population is concentrated in urban areas, limiting
                deforestation to a certain extent. Rapid urban growth has threatened natural habitats. The country has
                widespread environmental issues; pollution of the Dhaleshwari River by the textile industry and shrimp
                cultivation in Chakaria Sundarbans have both been described by academics as ecocides.[75][76] Although
                many areas are protected under law, some Bangladeshi wildlife is threatened by this growth. The
                Bangladesh Environment Conservation Act was enacted in 1995. The government has designated several
                regions as Ecologically Critical Areas, including wetlands, forests, and rivers. The Sundarbans tiger
                project and the Bangladesh Bear Project are among the key initiatives to strengthen conservation.[72] It
                ratified the Rio Convention on Biological Diversity on 3 May 1994.[77] As of 2014, the country was set
                to revise its National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan.[77]</p>

            <h2>Government and Politics</h2>
            <p><i>Main articles: Government of Bangladesh and Politics of Bangladesh</i></p>
            <img src="img/gov-bangladesh.jpeg" alt="Bangladesh">
            <p>Bangladesh is a de jure representative democracy under its constitution, with a Westminster-style
                parliamentary republic that has universal suffrage. The head of government is the Prime Minister, who
                forms a government every five years. The President invites the leader of the largest party in parliament
                to become prime minister.[78]</p>

            <p>The Government of Bangladesh is overseen by a cabinet headed by the Prime Minister of Bangladesh. The
                tenure of a parliamentary government is five years. The Bangladesh Civil Service assists the cabinet in
                running the government. Recruitment for the civil service is based on a public examination. In theory,
                the civil service should be a meritocracy. But a disputed quota system coupled with politicisation and
                preference for seniority have allegedly affected the civil service's meritocracy.[79] The President of
                Bangladesh is the ceremonial head of state[80] whose powers include signing bills passed by parliament
                into law. The President is the Supreme Commander of the Bangladesh Armed Forces and the chancellor of
                all universities. The Supreme Court of Bangladesh is the highest court of the land, followed by the High
                Court and Appellate Divisions. The head of the judiciary is the Chief Justice of Bangladesh, who sits on
                the Supreme Court. The courts have wide latitude in judicial review, and judicial precedent is supported
                by Article 111 of the constitution. The judiciary includes district and metropolitan courts divided into
                civil and criminal courts. Due to a shortage of judges, the judiciary has a large backlog.</p>
            <p>The Jatiya Sangshad (National Parliament) is the unicameral parliament. It has 350 members of parliament
                (MPs), including 300 MPs elected on the first past the post system and 50 MPs appointed to reserved
                seats for women's empowerment. Article 70 of the Constitution of Bangladesh forbids MPs from voting
                against their party. However, several laws proposed independently by MPs have been transformed into
                legislation, including the anti-torture law.[81] The parliament is presided over by the Speaker of the
                Jatiya Sangsad, who is second in line to the president as per the constitution.[82]</p>
