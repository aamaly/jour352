                <p>In a small shop tucked away in Dunkirk, Maryland, one might not immediately realize the connections that bind its patrons, owners, and artwork together.</p>

                <p>Behind the counter of this quaint family-owned art gallery and frame shop, Teresa Schrodel and her brother Frank Radosevic quietly maintain their family’s legacy at Medart Gallery, which began as their parents’ nearly half a century ago.</p>

                <p>Beyond the artwork, perfected frames, and handcrafted jewelry, there’s something else customers return for— a sense of community and shared history that feels more like family than business.</p>

                <p class="blockquote">
                    “We’re not just a store,” Schrodel said, smiling as she gestured to a regular customer Vivian Cawood, 73, who was waiting for Schrodel to hem her clothes. “We’ve known each other for years. She came in right after her husband passed away, and we just connected.”
                </p>
                <footer class="blockquote-footer">— Teresa Schrodel</footer>

                <p>Cawood, a local artist and long-time customer, nodded in agreement as she recalled how her relationship with the shop blossomed into something far more personal.</p>

                <p class="blockquote">
                    “I was newly widowed, and Teresa had lost her husband too. We commiserated, you know, over being widows. And now, well, we’re just friends,” Cawood said. “There’s [twenty] years between us, but we bonded.”
                </p>
                <footer class="blockquote-footer">— Vivian Cawood</footer>

                <p>Cawood first came into the shop to have a watercolor painting framed and has been a regular since. “I come here for everything,” she said. “I’ve bought jewelry, pottery, paintings– you name it. The jewelry Teresa designs, in honor of her mother, is just beautiful.”</p>

                <p>Then, Cawood pointed out one of the photographs on the wall, showing Schrodel and Radosevic’s late mother. “She was from Italy, gorgeous. Teresa made the entire jewelry line to honor her,” Cawood said.</p>

                <p>For Schrodel, it’s all about maintaining that personal touch. “We work hard to keep our relationships alive. People say we’re expensive, but we put in the quality. My brother is meticulous with framing, and I take care of the jewelry and customer relations,” she said.</p>

                <p>The shop’s story dates back to 1968 when Schrodel and Radosevic’s father, a retired Navy officer, started selling Italian oil paintings in the U.S. after meeting their mother in Italy. “He’d import paintings from his Navy buddy and sell them up and down the East Coast,” Schrodel said. “It started small but grew quickly.”</p>

                <p>Eventually, their parents opened their first store at Andrews Air Force Base. “What was supposed to be a three-week show turned into three years,” Schrodel said as she laughed. “My brother and I basically grew up with this business.”</p>

                    <p>When their mother passed away after falling down a flight of stairs, the siblings took over the shop. Their father continued to help out until his death last year at the age of 93.</p>

                    <p>The shop’s success hasn’t been without challenges. Radosevic is the only one who does the framing, which means the wait can be long. But customers, like Cawood, don’t mind. “I tell people it’s worth the wait. Frank’s work is exceptional. If he sees a speck of dust, he’ll take the whole thing apart and start over,” Cawood said.</p>

                    <p>Schrodel agreed. “People are paying good money, so we deliver more than they expect. There’s no price sheet because no two pieces are alike. Every piece of art needs something different, and Frank knows exactly what that is.”</p>

                    <p>Radosevic, who has a degree in photography from the George Washington University's Corcoran School of Arts, has been honing his crafts for decades. “He framed for classmates during school and got quite the reputation,” Schrodel said.</p>

                <p>The shop hosts an open house each holiday season, inviting locals to enjoy food and drinks and browse the latest artwork. “It’s like a big party,” Schrodel said, pulling out a flyer for an upcoming event featuring a local historical artist. “People come back every year, not just for the art, but for the connection.”</p>

                <p>The shop also gave local artists like Cawood a platform to sell their work. “I’ve sold cards here, and Teresa’s always been generous,” Cawood said. “They split the commission 50/50, which is fair. I couldn’t ask for a better place to display my art.”</p>

                <p>With nearly 50 years in business, Teresa Schrodel and Frank Radosevic have no plans to slow down. “We love what we do,” Schrodel said. “This shop isn’t just a business– it’s our family legacy. And the friendships we’ve made along the way; that’s the best part.”</p>

        <p class="blockquote">
            “I don’t know what I’d do without this place,” Cawood said. “It’s home.”
